[!NOTE]
This malware acts as a storage virus, filling up the C folder with useless dummy files until the storage space is exhausted. As a result, the computer's performance slows down because the operating system struggles to manage the limited space. These dummy files serve no purpose other than occupying storage, making it difficult for the system to locate and process essential files, ultimately affecting the overall speed and responsiveness of the computer. Detecting and preventing such malware requires effective antivirus measures and regular system scans.
